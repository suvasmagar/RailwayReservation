<b>How and Why We Started</b>
    <br>

The journey of RailYatri started two years back when a handful of technology experts got together to remove the information black-box that shrouds information regarding Indian Railways. Indian Railways is the preferred transportation mode for a vast majority of Indian population, yet pertinent information is not readily available and the information rather available is scattered. It is then, RailYatri stepped in to tackle such worries of its railway passengers. It has always aimed to be the capable train travel advisor helping passengers make informed decisions about their train travel.

We, at RailYatri do not just stop at presenting the dry numbers, but provide insights behind them. We offer analytical based information that makes us standout alone of the other sources of information. This is why our usersâ€™ base has been growing with every passing day.
